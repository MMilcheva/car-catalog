**\# Car catalog**

Spring BootAPI for car catalog with information about the cars in

it with that database model shown in a separate file.

For creation of the model one can use any type of relational database

you know. To complete the task one must:

1\\. Implement all the CRUD operation for create, update and delete.

Be aware that you must add validation on creation

for all mandatory fields because we can\'t create any of the

entities without them and throw exception if any of

the mandatory fields are missing in the request.

2\\. Implement search functionality on cars. For search criteria must
use

PRICE, MODEL, BRAND and FUEL_TYPE, REG_DATE, TRANSMISSION_TYPE and ORBER

BY PRICE descending.
